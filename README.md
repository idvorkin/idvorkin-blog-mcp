# Blog MCP Server

A FastMCP server that provides tools for interacting with Igor's blog at [idvork.in](https://idvork.in). Built with FastMCP 2.0 for automatic tool registration and protocol handling.

## ðŸš€ Live Server

**Production URL**: https://idvorkin-blog-mcp.fastmcp.app/mcp

- Automatically deploys on push to main branch
- Requires API key for authentication
- Powered by FastMCP Cloud hosting

## Architecture

- **FastMCP 2.0**: High-level Python framework that handles all MCP protocol details
- **GitHub Source**: Reads markdown files directly from the `idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io` repository
- **Simple Tools**: Each tool is just a decorated Python function - no manual protocol implementation
- **Type Safety**: Automatic schema generation from Python type hints
